Why do we need headers any idea?

    when we want to send something when you make request from FE to BE;


axios.post(url,{ }) 
// url , body , methodtype

ex - contenttype :application/json


What is axios?
    axios is alternative to js inbuild fetch method used to communicate between Front end and backend 

axios.post('url',{ })

url --> baseurl --> flipkart.com/getproduct  
                                /sellproduct


url --> baseurl/route
